It is a web 3D GIS engine.

## demo

![example-simple](imgs/simpleDemo.png)

Oh no, it looks not so good! Don't worry, it's just a little baby, we are working on it now.

## development

### build

Before building it, please install nodejs and npm firstly. Then you can follow the commands to build:

```
npm install
webpack
```

If there is no any error, as result, you will get `dist\f3Earth.js`, which is what we want.
